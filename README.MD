Computer Modern Mono - CMM
==========================

About
-----
Computer Modern Mono is a classic late 18th century Didone font originally based on Monotype 8a.
Thanks to the popular TeX typesetting system which used this font as base, numerous other scripts than latin has been covered.
This project aims to combine a large range of glyphs that blend together in the style of Computer Modern Sans Serif and Computer Modern Roman, and to make them monospace - proportional width - to create a high quality IDE programming and Terminal font.

The basis for Computer Modern Mono comes from two excellent font collections:
Computer Modern Unicode [1]
cwTeX TTF [2]

Those in turn based on the font collections:
cwTeX [3]
Un-fonts [4]
Latin1 (Metafont ec, tc, vnr) [1]
Cyrillic (lh)
Greek (cbgreek when available)
Code sets and IPA extensions (from tipa)

Computer Modern Unicode covers a large part from Latin, Greek, Cyrillic and IPA extensions.
cwTeX covers a large part of CJK - Chinese, Japanese and Korean glyphs.
These two collections are in turn based on the TeX Computer Modern typefaces by Donald Knuth, which in turn was based on the Monotype 8a typeface.
As all typefaces have a common heritage and are designed to fit together in scientific reports written in the TeX typesetting system, they blend perfectly together with a very large glyph coverage.

There are two variants of the Computer Modern Mono, a Sans Serif typeface with Yen CJK characters, and a Serif'd (Roman) variant with Ming CJK characters.

Thanks to the autohinter in ttfautohint[5], the font is excellently rendered on Linux and Windows with sub-pixel hinting.
